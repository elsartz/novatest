  # Note Sampler
  
  ## Note taker with React & Flask
  
  > An example of kepping notes and handle them with React.js as front-end and Python's Flask as a back-end using MySQL as a database server. The combination can be tricky if you want to publish it with Heroku or try to containerize it with Docker.

  # Installation
    It uses 'Vite', one of the quickest libraries to build your front-end application. 
    Also MUI packages to manipulate the UI as you prefer plus a custom CSS for convinience. 
    As for the back-end SQLAlchemy is responsible for the requests of the user with the database. 
    There is a future connection with a cloud database if connected with Heroku. 

  # Usage
    Keeping notes always is a useful thing ;)
